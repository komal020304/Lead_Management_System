 # Lead Management System

## Project Overview

The **Lead Management System** is a full-stack application built with the **MERN** stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). It serves as a platform for Key Account Managers (KAMs) to manage their leads, points of contact (POCs), interactions, and call planning. The application allows KAMs to track and manage leads efficiently while ensuring easy access to relevant data via an intuitive user interface.

### Features:
- **User Authentication**: KAMs can register, log in, and securely access their data.
- **Lead Management**: Add, update, and view leads with their respective statuses.
- **POC Management**: Manage Points of Contact (POCs) for each lead.
- **Interaction Management**: Record and track interactions with leads.
- **Call Planning**: Track leads that need follow-up calls today.
